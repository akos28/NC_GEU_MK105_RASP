<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About RASP
Our solution basically uses historical job data for information about the location, salary and requirements and News articles that provide information about the future (ie. predictions).

We decided the best way to work was to split our team into 3 divisions:
  * **Philomath** - Data acquisition division
  * **Venus** - Front-end division
  * **Maeve** - Big Data & ML analysis division

For detailed explanation about Project Joopiter, you can read [this](https://icecereal.github.io/blog/we-won-the-smart-india-hackathon/) blog article.

### Built With

* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)
